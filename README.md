## React Router Dom v6 Catch All Route Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the catch-all route (`/*`) in React Router Dom v6.  The problem arises when the catch-all route fails to correctly handle routes that don't match any other defined routes, leading to unexpected behavior or rendering issues.

The `App.js` file contains the buggy implementation, while `AppSolution.js` provides the corrected version.
